            Being a designer I have always been passionate about visual storytelling and had a keen eye for creating
            stunning graphics that captivated audiences. However as my career progressed, I craved a deeper connection
            with my audience and  was intrigued by the idea of designing interfaces that were not just visually
            appealing but also intuitive and user-friendly. I am drawn to the challenge of solving complex design
            problems and creating designs that truly made a difference in people's lives.</span>

            <h3>  A Heading for your Favorite Animal</h3>
                <p>Penguins (order Sphenisciformes /sfɪˈnɪsɪfɔːrmiːz/, 
                    family Spheniscidae /sfɪˈnɪsɪdiː/) are a group of aquatic 
                    flightless birds. They live almost exclusively in the Southern 
                    Hemisphere: only one species, the Galápagos penguin, is found north 
                    of the Equator. Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have countershaded dark and white 
                    plumage and flippers for swimming. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sea life which they catch with their bills and swallow it whole while swimming. A penguin has a spiny tongue and powerful jaws to grip slippery prey</p>
